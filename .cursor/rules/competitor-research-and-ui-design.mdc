description: The "Competitor Research and UI Design Rule" provides a structured process for designing new features or components to ensure they are competitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly. It emphasizes researching how leading products implement similar features, gathering multidisciplinary feedback (from UI, UX, and graphic design perspectives), using sequential design thinking to balance aesthetics and usability, adhering to the design system, and iterating based on reviews and benchmarks.

# Competitor Research and UI Design Rule

## Overview
When designing new features or components, follow this structured process to ensure the result is competitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly:

## 1. Competitor Research
- Use available search tools to conduct thorough competitor research.
- Gather data on how similar features/components are implemented in leading products.
- Document findings, focusing on:
  - Layout and structure
  - Data order and prioritization
  - Visual style and branding
  - Use of theme or design system components

## 2. Multidisciplinary Input
- Actively seek input from the following roles:
  - **Master UI Designer:** Focus on visual hierarchy, color, spacing, and overall aesthetics.
  - **User Experience Engineer:** Prioritize usability, accessibility, and intuitive flows.
  - **Graphic Designer:** Ensure iconography, imagery, and branding are cohesive and high quality.
- Synthesize feedback from all three perspectives before proceeding.

## 3. Sequential Design Thinking
- Use sequential thinking tools to:
  - Weigh the input from each discipline
  - Resolve conflicts between aesthetics and usability
  - Arrive at a final design that meets requirements and is visually appealing

## 4. Implementation Guidelines
- Use core components and as many built-in theme components as possible.
- Adhere to the design system for consistency.
- Document the rationale for design decisions, referencing competitor research and multidisciplinary input.

## 5. Review and Iterate
- After implementation, review the design against competitor benchmarks and multidisciplinary feedback.
- Iterate as needed to ensure the highest quality outcome.
