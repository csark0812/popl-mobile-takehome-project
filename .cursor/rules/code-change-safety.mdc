# Code Change Safety and Debugging Rule

- Only change code if you are confident it addresses the root cause of the problem, not just the surface behavior.
- After making a fix, double check that no new errors or warnings were introduced. If any appear, verify they are unrelated to the task and do not impact correctness, stability, or expected output.
- If the root cause isn't fully clear:
  1. Add logging or descriptive errors to trace internal state and flow.
  2. Focus on identifying and fixing the underlying issueâ€”not just silencing symptoms.
- When investigating bugs or unclear issues, proactively try to gather external information (such as documentation, error explanations, or similar bug reports) via tool calls to improve your understanding and solution quality.
