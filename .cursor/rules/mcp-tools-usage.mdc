# MCP Tools Usage Rule

When solving coding tasks in this project, follow these guidelines for using your mcp tools:

1. **ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly and include all required parameters.**
2. **NEVER call tools that are not available.**
3. **Bias toward using tools to gather or confirm useful information.**
4. **Use tools to retain or reason through information as needed.**
5. **Use tools when they will improve accuracy or clarity.**
6. **Err on the side of gathering more context via tools.**
7. **If a tool call is successful but the response from the tool call returns an error, attempt to rerun the tool up to 3 times based on the error provided.**
8. **Tool calls that are additive (gathering information, reasoning, or analysis) are auto-approved and do not require explicit user confirmation.**
9. **Tool calls that are destructive (deleting, overwriting, or making irreversible changes) MUST require explicit user approval before execution.**

Use your tools proactively to:
- Gather information about the codebase, files, or project structure.
- Confirm assumptions or fill in knowledge gaps.
- Retain, reason through, or analyze information as needed for the task.
- Ensure your answers are as accurate and clear as possible.
- Prefer tool-based investigation over guessing or making unsupported assumptions.
